Lua Graphics Toolkit
====================

The Lua Graphics Toolkit is a Lua module for creating plots and graphical
animations using a simple Lua interface. It works both on Windows and Linux
systems.

The core functions of the module are implemented in C and C++ using the Lua's C API.
A second layer of functions are implemented in Lua.

Currently only LuaJIT2 is officially supported but nothing prevent to use
the library with the standad Lua implementation (PUC-Rio).
