Lua Graphics Toolkit
====================

Installation instructions
-------------------------

You can compile the Lua Graphics Toolkit on linux by installing the appropriate development packages. The libraries you will need and their package's name for
debian based systems are:

- Anti-Grain geometry library, libagg-dev package
- Freetype library, libfreetype6-dev package
- LuaJIT2 shared library, libluajit-5.1-dev package

Once the packages above are installed you should be able to compile simply by typing:

> make

Then you can install the module on your system by using:

> make install

or, as an alternative, you can build a debian package using

> make debian

The Lua's package will be named "graph" and can be called from luajit using

> require("graph")

Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

The Lua Graphics Toolkit can be installed on Windows using the mingw toolchain. To succeed you will need to compile before all the required libraries, edit the Makefile to add the
path where the libraries are located.

We strongly reccomend of using binary package on Windows.
